# Responsive Portfolia
<!--  
theres a section in the good read me example that says "At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them here."
<!-- Functional, deployed application
GitHub repository with README describing the project
Navbar must be consistent on each page.
Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.
All links must work.
Must use semantic html.
Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)
Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)
Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system -->


### The goal of this project is to make a portfolio that works with all screen sizes using mainly the html Bootstrap framework. The portfolio needs to be beautiful, easy to use and available across different devices.  
## Features 


__1. A navbar__
 
_Why?_

In order to reach other pages of my portfolio I need a way to easily navigate between them. Another issue is that the nav bar needs to be able to adjust with the size of the viewing window, intelligently and beautifully. 

_What?/How?_



__2. A Responsive Layout__

_Why?_

Not everyone wants to use the same size screen, sometimes we use phone sometimes we use giant monitors. The layout of my portfolio needs to look good where ever it is being viewed.

_What?/How?_

 

__3. Responsive images__

_Why?_

Two reasons: Just in case the image does not show up and to make the page usable and understandable even if the user cannot see the image. 



_What?/How?_

By finding this code:
img src="./assets/images/lead-generation.png" and turning it into this:
img src="./assets/images/lead-generation.png" alt="gears going down into money"

Notice what I added: alt="gears going down into money"
    
A simply alt= with a good description in quoatation marks, it doesn't need to be long and detailed as long as the core of the image is described.

## Usage
### How do you use this project? You may use it nearly anyway you see fit however, if you feel lost, scared and alone; I have some suggestions for you. 
 1. You may admire it, sit back and take in the beauty. Peruse through the code. Enjoy it as if it were an old coletrain record, Bach or Monet. So, I might not be quite there yet but not every note written by Bach was divined, Coletain didn't start out great and in the beginning Monet's art looked like everyone elses at the time.
 2. You can judge it. You can critisize and even give useful feedback. How can I improve? Do you know how to write code as beautiful as Monet paints- I want to know your secrets.
 3. You can x out. You came here by accident and only realized right now you weren't suppose to be here. So, it's cool. Have a good night. 

 ## Credits

I would like to thank Kerwin, Manuel Jerome and all my classmates for helping me understand this subject matter and anyone that contributed to make the base code.
